	Initial journal entry, horray! In all seriousness I may end up changing how I store this file, since this may become very bloated very quickly. 
	After reading the AI book loaned to me by Dr. Wilson, I have came to the conclusion that I will be using a decision tree to modle my Agent. 
	This doens't suprise me too much, as that type of logical structure has been how I've been thinking about this project from the begining, since 
	the full decision making higharchy will be hardcoded. Though it is nice to see how such a system would be implimented, and formalizing things 
	is always nice. 

	This folder will contain all reference material I use in the creation of my project, but will not hold any of the actual assets used by my project. 
	The first amongst these is "Card play priority.pdf", which currently contains a high level breakdown of the logic flow used by the agent when 
	selecting a card to play at any given point in the game. The boxes describing various conditions implicitly mean that a check will be made to see 
	if any cards fit the given conditions for that paticular play choice. If they do then that event is executed, with dotted lines going to additional 
	logic subtrees as needed. This list is not complete though and will be supplimented and changed as necessary, the biggest supplement being the 
	hiearchy of card events, which will be its own file. 

	I'm not sure what else to add at the moment, but will keep maintaining this with random jottings and ideas I have to help document the developement 
	process. I'm going to create the file for the card hiearchys and possible add to what I already have decided later tonight.

    Done some research into creating an executable and it is pretty much as straightforward as I thought. Just need to compile the file in a specific way.
    As for making a GUI, that's going to be a lot more complicated. Since I'm aiming for a Windows audience the best thing to use looks like the Windows 
    API, which will require coding my project in C++, which I had planned on doing anyways. Yay for convince making my decisions for me.
    I don't know entirely how difficult it will be to use the API, need to read more on how I would use it.

	After doing further reserch into the Windows API, I believe the type of program I will be creating is a Win32 application. Reading up on this, it is a
	decently meaty subject to learn about. Enough so that I am wondering wheather or not this project will be as feasable as I first thought. Though it is 
	suppost to be challenging, I feel like some prior knowledge in this feild would be greatly useful. As of now I am following along a serise of tutorials 
	walking through the process of how Win32 apps work, they can be found at: http://www.relisoft.com/win32/index.html. I'm still trying to process though 
	everything so more will follow later. Though I am certain this is the correct direction to be going in terms of what kind of program I will make.

	Added some resources that will be used as reference material. Have also decided that card dealing will be handeled by the program ant the user will simply
	be told which cards they have been delat. They will need a way to refrence them however, for only the names will be given. 
	Additionally I have came up with a list of use cases that my project will be using. For now they will be listed here.

	Start a game
		-Select Side
		-Optinal Rules/Varients
		-Place Starting Influence

	Deal Cards
		-Aknolege Recevial of Cards

	Play a Card
		-Select Card
		-Event/Value/Scoring
		-if Value: 
			-Influence/Coup/Realingment/Space Race
			-Target(s)

	Proposal and presentation have gone well thus far. More frequent updates will probably follow this entry because weekly progress updates are a required part of 
	the remainder of the semester. As far as a goal for the end of the semester, I intend to have completed the serise of tutorials that I am currently following 
	to learn the in's and out's of Win32 applications. With the possibility of creating the most basic shell on whith which my program will be built on. For my weekely
	goal I intend to have completed most of the "Generic" tutorial on the website. This being the second tutorial in the serise, but I am not sure if I will need 
	to complete all of them to learn what I need to know.
