	Initial journal entry, horray! In all seriousness I may end up changing how I store this file, since this may become very bloated very quickly. 
	After reading the AI book loaned to me by Dr. Wilson, I have came to the conclusion that I will be using a decision tree to modle my Agent. 
	This doens't suprise me too much, as that type of logical structure has been how I've been thinking about this project from the begining, since 
	the full decision making higharchy will be hardcoded. Though it is nice to see how such a system would be implimented, and formalizing things 
	is always nice. 

	This folder will contain all reference material I use in the creation of my project, but will not hold any of the actual assets used by my project. 
	The first amongst these is "Card play priority.pdf", which currently contains a high level breakdown of the logic flow used by the agent when 
	selecting a card to play at any given point in the game. The boxes describing various conditions implicitly mean that a check will be made to see 
	if any cards fit the given conditions for that paticular play choice. If they do then that event is executed, with dotted lines going to additional 
	logic subtrees as needed. This list is not complete though and will be supplimented and changed as necessary, the biggest supplement being the 
	hiearchy of card events, which will be its own file. 

	I'm not sure what else to add at the moment, but will keep maintaining this with random jottings and ideas I have to help document the developement 
	process. I'm going to create the file for the card hiearchys and possible add to what I already have decided later tonight.
